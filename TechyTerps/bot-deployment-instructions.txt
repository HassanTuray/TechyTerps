Nice 🎉 Glad it’s alive.

Here’s a clean, copy-and-paste guide you can drop in GroupMe/Discord/Notion for the rest of your team.

# 🧵 How to Set Up the GroupMe Bot on Replit

Follow these steps to get a GroupMe bot running on Replit and responding to messages.

---

## 1. Create the bot in GroupMe

1. Go to: [https://dev.groupme.com/bots](https://dev.groupme.com/bots)
2. Click **"Create Bot"**.
3. Choose the **group** you want the bot in.
4. Give it a name (e.g. `ReplitBot`).
5. Click **Submit**.
6. After creating it, you’ll see a **Bot ID** — **copy that**. We will paste it into the code.

---

## 2. Make the Replit project

1. Go to [https://replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Click **+ Create Repl**.
3. Choose **Python** (or **Flask** — either is fine, we’ll force-run it).
4. Name it (example): `GroupMeTest`.
5. Create the Repl.

---

## 3. Add the Python code

Create / edit `main.py` and paste this **exact** code (replace the BOT_ID):

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

# 🔴 REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR BOT ID FROM dev.groupme.com/bots
BOT_ID = "PASTE_YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "HEAD"])
def head_check():
    # GroupMe will use this to check if the URL is alive
    return "ok", 200

@app.route("/", methods=["POST"])
def callback():
    data = request.get_json()
    print("Received webhook:", data)

    if not data:
        return "ok", 200

    text = (data.get("text") or "").lower()

    if "hello" in text:
        send_message("Hey there! I'm your bot running on Replit.")
    elif "ping" in text:
        send_message("pong")
    elif "bye" in text:
        send_message("Goodbye!")

    return "ok", 200

def send_message(msg):
    url = "https://api.groupme.com/v3/bots/post"
    payload = {"bot_id": BOT_ID, "text": msg}
    r = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    print("Sent message:", msg, "status:", r.status_code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Bot server starting on Replit...")
    # Replit exposes port 8080
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

👉 **Important:** change

```python
BOT_ID = "PASTE_YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"
```

to your actual bot ID from GroupMe.

---

## 4. Tell Replit how to run it

Create (or edit) a file called **`.replit`** in the root of the project and put this in it:

```ini
run = "python3 main.py"
```

This forces Replit to run your Flask app directly (not gunicorn on port 5000).

---

## 5. Install Flask + Requests (Nix way)

Create (or edit) **`replit.nix`** and put this in:

```nix
{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    pkgs.python311Full
    pkgs.python311Packages.flask
    pkgs.python311Packages.requests
  ];
}
```

Replit will rebuild, then you can click **Run** again.

(If you don’t want to touch Nix, you can just `pip install flask requests` in the Replit shell, but the Nix way is cleaner.)

---

## 6. Run it and check it

1. Click **Run**.
2. In the console you should see:

   * `Bot server starting on Replit...`
   * `Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080`
3. Click **“Open in new tab”** (the webview).
4. In the browser you should see:

   ```
   ok
   ```

If you see `ok`, your Flask server is reachable ✅

---

## 7. Get the public URL

The URL in the browser will look like:

```text
https://<repl-name>.<your-username>.repl.co/
```

Example from our setup:

```text
https://GroupMeTest.hfturay1.repl.co/
```

**That exact URL** is the one GroupMe needs.

---

## 8. Add the callback in GroupMe

1. Go back to [https://dev.groupme.com/bots](https://dev.groupme.com/bots)

2. Click your bot → **Edit**

3. In **Callback URL**, paste your Replit URL, e.g.:

   ```text
   https://GroupMeTest.hfturay1.repl.co/
   ```

4. Click **Update**.

If GroupMe can reach it, it won’t show the “callback URL validation failed” error.

---

## 9. Test it

1. Go to the **GroupMe group** where the bot was added.

2. Send a message like:

   ```text
   ping
   ```

3. Look at the Replit console — you should see something like:

   ```text
   Received webhook: {'text': 'ping', ...}
   Sent message: pong status: 202
   ```

4. The bot should reply in the GroupMe chat.

---

## 10. Notes / Gotchas

* ✅ Replit must stay **running** for GroupMe to reach it.
* ✅ The bot must be **added to the GroupMe group** or it won’t receive messages.
* ✅ The callback must be **HTTPS** (Replit gives HTTPS by default).
* ✅ If someone else in the group makes their **own** Replit, they must use **their** Replit URL and **their** GroupMe Bot ID.

---

## 11. TL;DR for teammates

1. Make a bot on [https://dev.groupme.com/bots](https://dev.groupme.com/bots) → copy **Bot ID**
2. Make a Replit → paste the Flask code → put your **Bot ID** in it
3. Add `.replit` with `run = "python3 main.py"`
4. Run → open URL → see `ok`
5. Paste that URL back into the bot’s **Callback URL**
6. Say “ping” in the group → bot replies “pong”

---

You can send that to the team as-is. If you want, I can make a version with placeholders like `<YOUR_BOT_ID>` / `<YOUR_REPL_URL>` so they don’t forget to change those.
